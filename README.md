# Filters

The following is a collection of filters available to be used to change settings
and options from the theme at any point.

- `lean/acf_path`: With this filter you can change the location of the ACF files,
by default saves the ACF Groups into the `acf` directory located on the theme.
- `lean/acf_use_custom_location`: By default to `true` with this filter you can
remove the automatic save of ACF Fields into the `lean/acf_path` and works as 
it does not have any settings on.
